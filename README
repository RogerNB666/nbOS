BLFS -- A minimal operating system with GUI based on Linux.

Compiling

Compiling the bootloader requires x86_64-pe-BINUTILS.

This system is based on Linux 5.13.12. You should download the
Linux 5.13.12 packet to src directory and unpack it, then 
switch to directory src and run the file build_linux.sh to
compile the Linux kernel.

# cd src
# ./build_linux.sh

After it finishes compiling, switch back to root directory of source.

# cd ..

Then enter "make".

# make

When the message "./install/install.img is ready." is printed, you can
write the file install/install.img to your USB drive.
